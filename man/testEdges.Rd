}
\arguments{
\item{networksDF}{A data.frame output from \code{\link{runSCORPION}} containing
TF-target pairs as rows and network identifiers as columns.}

\item{testType}{Character specifying the test type. Options are:
\itemize{
  \item{"single": Single-sample test (one-sample t-test against zero)}
  \item{"two.sample": Two-sample comparison (t-test between two groups)}
}}

\item{group1}{Character vector of column names in \code{networksDF} representing
the first group (or the only group for single-sample tests).}

\item{group2}{Character vector of column names in \code{networksDF} representing
the second group. Required for two-sample tests, ignored for single-sample tests.}

\item{paired}{Logical indicating whether to perform a paired t-test. Default FALSE.
When TRUE, group1 and group2 must have the same length and be in matched order
(e.g., group1[1] is paired with group2[1]). Useful for comparing matched samples
such as Tumor vs Normal from the same patient.}

\item{alternative}{Character specifying the alternative hypothesis. Options:
"two.sided" (default), "greater", or "less".}

\item{padjustMethod}{Character specifying the p-value adjustment method for multiple
testing correction. See \code{\link[stats]{p.adjust}} for options. Default "BH"
(Benjamini-Hochberg FDR).}

\item{minMeanEdge}{Numeric threshold for minimum mean absolute edge weight to
include in testing. Edges with mean absolute weight below this threshold are
excluded. Default 0 (no filtering).}
}
\value{
A data.frame containing:
  \itemize{
    \item{tf: Transcription factor}
    \item{target: Target gene}
    \item{meanEdge: Mean edge weight}
    \item{tStatistic: Test statistic}
    \item{pValue: Raw p-value}
    \item{pAdj: Adjusted p-value}
    \item{For two-sample tests: meanGroup1, meanGroup2, diffMean (Group1 - Group2), log2FoldChange}
  }
}
\description{
Performs statistical testing of network edges from runSCORPION output.
Supports single-sample tests (testing if edges differ from zero) and two-sample
tests (comparing edges between two groups).
}
\details{
For single-sample tests, the function tests whether the mean edge weight across
replicates significantly differs from zero using a one-sample t-test.

For two-sample tests, the function compares edge weights between two groups
using Welch's t-test (unequal variances assumed).

For paired tests, the function calculates the difference between matched pairs
and performs a one-sample t-test on the differences (testing if mean difference
differs from zero). This is appropriate when samples are matched (e.g., Tumor
and Normal from the same patient).

Edges are tested independently, and p-values are adjusted for multiple testing
using the specified method.

The function uses fully vectorized computations for efficiency, making it suitable
for large-scale analyses with millions of edges. T-statistics and p-values are
calculated using matrix operations without iteration.
