Description: Constructs cell-type–specific gene regulatory networks from single-cell RNA-sequencing data. The method implements the SCORPION algorithm, which first aggregates individual cells into super-cells and then applies PANDA (Passing Attributes between Networks for Data Assimilation) to infer transcription factor–target regulatory relationships. It also provides statistical methods for differential edge analysis.
